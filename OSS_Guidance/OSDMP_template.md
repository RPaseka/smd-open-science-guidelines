# Open Science and Data Management Plan Sample Template
*Italicized text is included for explanatory purposes throughout this template and should be omitted from the Open Science and Data Management Plan (OSDMP). This template provides one example of the format and contents of an OSDMP. For most proposals, the OSDMP should not exceed a total length of two pages. If there are costs associated with performing the tasks described in the OSDMP, those costs should be accounted for in the proposal budget and/or budget justification.* 

*Please follow any specific instructions for the OSDMP in your funding solicitation. SMD divisions may provide additional OSDMP guidance or templates that are tailored to specific research communities. General guidance on the OSDMP is available in the SMD Open-Source Science Guidance and on the [ROSES OSDMP web page](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/faqs/OSDMP). Questions regarding this template may be directed to [HQ-SMD-SPD41@mail.nasa.gov](HQ-SMD-SPD41@mail.nasa.gov).*  

## 1. Data Management Plan
*A data management plan is required for all SMD-funded activities that are expected to produce scientific data. Here it is incorporated into the broader OSDMP. Follow any specific requirements for the data management plan that are provided by the funding solicitation or relevant SMD Division. At a minimum, the DMP includes the following elements:*

### 1.1 Expected data types, formats, volumes, and standards 
*Describe the data expected to be produced from the proposed activities. Include the types of data to be produced, the approximate amount of each data type expected, the machine-readable format of the data, data file format, and any applicable standards for the data or associated metadata.* 

### 1.2 Repositories and timeline for sharing data
*Specify the repository(ies) that will be used to archive and provide public access to data and metadata arising from the activities and the schedule for making data publicly available. Include a description of how data will be archived to enable long-term preservation.* 

### 1.3. Description of data types that are exempt from data sharing requirements
*Specify data types that are excluded from requirements to make the data publicly available and cite the relevant laws, regulations, or policies that generate the exclusion.*

## 2. Software Management 
*A software management plan is required for all SMD-funded activities that are expected to produce software. Here it is incorporated into the broader OSDMP. Follow any specific requirements for the software management plan that are provided by the funding solicitation or SMD Division. If the activity is not expected to produce software, include a statement such as:
“No software development is anticipated for this effort. If software is created, it will be made publicly available to the extent legally permitted per the Scientific Information Policy for the Science Mission Directorate.”*

### 2.1 Expected software types
*Describe the software expected to be produced from the proposed activities, including types of software to be produced, how the software will be developed, and the addition of new features or updates to existing software. This can include the platforms used for development, project management, and community-based best practices to be included such as documentation, testing, dependencies, and versioning.* 

### 2.2 Repositories and timeline for sharing software
*Specify the repository(ies) that will be used to archive software arising from the activities and the schedule for making software publicly available. This should include the license under which the software will be made available. If there are no other restrictions, the software should be released under a permissive license.* 

### 2.3 Description of software that are exempt from software sharing requirements
*Specify software  types that are excluded from requirements to make the software publicly available and cite the relevant laws, regulations, or policies that generate the exclusion.*

## Open Science Plan

### 3.1 Publication Sharing
*Describe the types of publications that are expected to be produced from the activities (e.g., peer reviewed manuscripts, technical reports, conference materials, and books). Outline the methods expected to be used to make the publications publicly available, which will likely include options listed under ‘How to Share Publications’ in the SMD Open-Source Science Guidance. This may include posting manuscripts to community-appropriate preprint servers, making accepted manuscripts publicly available in NASA's STI Repository, or publishing manuscripts as Open Access in reputable journals. Note that costs for Open Access publishing may be included in proposal budgets.* 

### 3.2 Other Open Science Activities 
*Optionally, the OSDMP may include a description of additional open science activities associated with the project (if not described elsewhere in a proposal). This may include: holding scientific workshops and meetings openly to enable broad participation, providing project personnel with open science training or enablement, implementing practices that support the inclusion of broad, diverse communities in the scientific process as close to the start of research activities as possible if not described elsewhere, and contributions to or involvement in open-science communities.*

## Roles and Responsibilities 
*Specify the project personnel who will ensure the implementation of the OSDMP. This may be its own section or integrated into the sections above.*
