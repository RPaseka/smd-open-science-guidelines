# SMD Division Policies and Guidance
SPD-41a ensures that requirements for sharing scientific information are consistent across SMD. Additionally, SMD divisions developed the following policies and guidance to put the requirements of SPD-41a into context for specific scientific communities. These policies and other resources were developed with input from the relevant research communities and provide additional details and examples to support the implementation of SPD-41a.

SMD divisions coordinated with one another and the SMD Chief Science Data Office to ensure consistency across policies. If you have questions about which policies or guidelines are applicable to your work, contact the Program Officer for your solicitation or award, division representatives, or the Chief Science Data Office at HQ-SMD-SPD41@mail.nasa.gov.
