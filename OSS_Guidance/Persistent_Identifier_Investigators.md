# Persistent Identifiers for Investigators

## How to Obtain a Persistent Identifier
SPD-41a requires SMD-funded investigators to have a persistent identifier that meets the standards of a digital persistent identifier service defined in the [NSPM-33 Implementation Guidance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/010422-NSPM-33-Implementation-Guidance.pdf). Many SMD-funded researchers meet this requirement using [ORCID](https://orcid.org/), an organization that provides a unique, persistent identifier (the ORCID iD) to distinguish among researchers. [Register for an ORCID iD here.](https://orcid.org/register) 

## Using a Persistent Identifier 
Starting with ROSES-2023, PIs and Co-Is must provide their persistent identifiers (e.g., ORCID iD) via the [NSPIRES](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/) submission process. 

SMD encourages researchers to include their ORCID iDs in scientific outputs, which provides a mechanism for researchers to document their unique scientific records, improve the discoverability of their work, and gain recognition for reviews, awards, and more.
