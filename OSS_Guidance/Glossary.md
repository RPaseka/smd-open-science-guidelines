# Glossary of Open-Source Science Terms 

Most terms in this section are copied from Appendix B of SPD-41a. Additional terms are noted here with an asterisk (*). 
 
Archive: The process of storing data to ensure long term retention. 
 
Accessible: As per the definition in the FAIR principles, data are retrievable by their identifier using standardized communications protocols. 
 
Commercial Software: Software produced for the purposes of sale. This includes software that would be classified as commercial-off-the-shelf (CoTS) and software that NASA does not have a license to distribute. 
 
Data: Scientific or technically relevant information that can be stored digitally and accessed electronically. 
Information produced by missions include observations, calibrations, coefficients, documentation, algorithms, and any ancillary information. Further definitions of mission data and examples are provided in Appendix E. 
Information needed to validate the scientific conclusions of peer-reviewed publications. This includes the data required to derive the findings communicated in figures, maps, and tables. 
This does not include laboratory notebooks, preliminary analyses, intermediate data products, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer review reports, communications with colleagues, or physical objects, such as laboratory specimens. 
 
Data Management Plan (DMP): A document that describes whether and how data will be shared and preserved. A DMP should be compliant with NASA policies. 
 
Findable: As per the definition in the FAIR principles, metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. 
 
Interoperable: As per the definition in the FAIR principles, data are able to work with other applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing. 
 
Machine readable*: Refers to information or data that is in a format that can be easily processed by a computer without human intervention while ensuring no semantic meaning is lost. (Source: https://resources.data.gov/glossary/machine-readable-file/) 

Open Access publication*: Although there are various uses of the term ‘open access’, this guidance document uses the term to refer to a method of publication in which the publisher makes the article and related content available online, free of charges or other barriers to access, immediately at the time of publication. Such articles are often licensed for sharing and reuse under a Creative Commons or similar license-type agreement that allows the authors to retain copyright while allowing others to copy, distribute, and reuse their work. 

Open Format: A file format for storing digital data that is defined by an openly published specification, usually maintained by a standards organization and that can be used and implemented by anyone. Open file format is licensed with an open license. 
 
Open Source Software (OSS): Software that can be accessed, used, modified, and shared by anyone. OSS is often distributed under licenses that comply with the definition of “Open Source” provided by the Open Source Initiative or meet the definition of “Free Software” provided by the Free Software Foundation. 
 
Persistent Identifier: A long-lasting reference to a digital source. The digital object identifier (DOI) system is an example of a persistent identifier. 
  
Permissive License: Guarantees the free use, modification, and redistribution of software, while still permitting proprietary derivative works. Examples include the Apache License 2.0, the BSD 3-Clause “Revised” License, and the MIT License. 
 
Publication: Document released through print, electronic, or alternative media. This includes peer reviewed manuscripts, technical reports, conference materials, and books. This does not include laboratory notebooks, preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers or preprints, plans for future research, peer review reports, or communications with colleagues. 
 
Report: Document produced through print, electronic, or alternative media containing scientific and technical information. These documents are typically not peer reviewed. Examples include technical publications, technical memorandums, contractor reports, conference publications, special publications, and technical translations. It does not include interim research grant reports. 
 
Repository: An organized storage location that makes data findable and accessible. 
 
Restricted Software: Software that shall not be released due to an existing Federal law or guidance, NASA policy, or security concern. This includes software supporting security requirements described in STD-1006. For Mission software, projects should engage with the software release authority to determine status. Examples of software that may be restricted are command related software, instrument control, authentication, or communication software. 
 
Review: Assessment of SMD-funded activities by an individual or group. This may include a panel, standing review board, or senior review. 
 
Reusable: As per the definition in the FAIR principles, metadata and data should be well-described so they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings. This includes releasing the data with a clear and accessible data usage policy. 
 
Scientific Information: Scientific knowledge produced as part of a research activity. This can include, but is not limited to, publications, data, and software. 
 
Scientific Software: Software that provides users some degree of scientific utility or produces a scientific result or service. 
 
Scientific Utility: Information that is necessary to validate research findings or beneficial for future research activities. 
 
Single Use Software: Software written for use in unique instances, such as making a plot for a paper or manipulating data in a specific way. 
 
Software: Computer programs in source and object code that provide users some degree of utility or produce a result or service. 
 
Software Project: An activity to develop software. A software project typically has a version control platform on which development can occur collaboratively. 
 
Source Code: A human-readable set of statements written in a programming language that together compose software. Programmers write software in source code, often saved as a text file on a computer. The terms code and source code are often used interchangeably.
