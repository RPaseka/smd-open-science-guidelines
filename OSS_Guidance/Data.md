# Data Management and Sharing 
Consistent with the principles of open-source science, data resulting from SMD-funding shall be made publicly available through methods that are transparent, inclusive, accessible, and reproducible. This section contains supplemental guidance to support the implementation of requirements for data management and sharing established by SPD-41a. In addition to these pages, researchers should reference the guidance provided in the data policies and guidance provided by their relevant SMD Divisions. These policies provide specific information about where, how, and what data should be shared including specific data repositories, metadata requirements, and recommended data formats. 

## Data in Scope of SPD-41a
Data are defined as scientific or technically relevant information that can be stored digitally and accessed electronically. This includes any scientifically useful data associated with an award.  In particular, the information needed to validate the scientific conclusions of peer-reviewed publications must be shared at the time of publication. This does not include laboratory notebooks, preliminary analyses, intermediate data products, drafts of scientific papers, plans for future research, peer review reports, communications with colleagues, or physical objects, such as laboratory specimens. 

Data subject to specific laws, regulations, or policies (e.g., Export Administration Regulations (EAR) or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)) that would prevent the release of this information are exempt from requirements for making data publicly available. Section II-C of SPD-41a lists additional laws, regulations, and policies that generate exceptions to data sharing requirements.

## Data Management Plans
All SMD-funded scientific activities that are expected to produce scientific data shall include data management plan describing the management, preservation, and release of data to facilitate implementation of relevant scientific information policies. The data management plan may be one component of a broader OSDMP. Though not required under SPD-41A, the OSDMP will be a required component of many proposals for SMD funding starting with ROSES-2023.

At a minimum, a data management plan for SMD-funded research should include:
* Descriptions of the data expected to be produced from the proposed activities, including types of data to be produced, the approximate amount of each data type expected, the machine-readable format of the data, data file format, and any applicable standards for the data or associated metadata 
* The repository (or repositories) that will be used to archive data and metadata arising from the activities and the schedule for making data publicly available 
* Description of data types that are subject to relevant laws, regulations, or policies that exclude them from data sharing requirements 
* Roles and responsibilities of project personnel who will ensure implementation of the data management plan

Data management plans should reflect the practices of specific research communities, and SMD Divisions and/or ROSES program elements may provide additional guidance on format and content. Specific guidance includes:
* Planetary Science Division guidance and template
* Heliophysics Division guidance and template
* Earth Science Division guidance

Researchers may benefit from using online, open-source tools such as DMPTool to create their data management plans. 

## Timeline for Sharing Data 
Scientific data resulting from SMD-funded scientific activities shall be made publicly available, to the extent allowed by applicable law and existing NASA policies, according to the following timeline:
1. Scientific data needed to validate the scientific conclusions of peer-reviewed manuscripts resulting from SMD-funded scientific activities shall become publicly available no later than the publication date of the corresponding peer-reviewed article. This includes data required to derive the findings communicated in figures, maps, and tables, as well as scientifically useful data from models and simulations.
2. Any scientifically useful data associated with a SMD research award shall be made publicly available by the end of the period of performance, whether or not the data would be needed to validate the scientific conclusions of a peer-reviewed publication. 

## Where to Share Data 
Data must be shared and archived in locations that ensure the accessibility and preservation of the data.   

Researchers should follow the guidance for how to share data as described in the relevant solicitation or division data policies. For some divisions, there are SMD-designated, domain specific data repositories (e.g., GeneLab, NExScI Science Data Archives, HLSP Data Collections) in which data developed under those programs should be shared. NASA’s Science Data page includes links with more information on each Division’s data repositories. Depending on the repository, this may require the data to be uploaded directly into the repository or this may be uploaded as part of the publication process. 

If there is no designated NASA repository, options for where to share research data can include: 
* In a non-SMD, federally supported data repository (e.g., data.nasa.gov). If using a different federally supported repository, this should be indicated in the data management plan.
* In public repositories already in use by the scientific community that have characteristics consistent with Desirable Characteristics of Data Repositories for Federally Funded Research; further examples will be provided but see examples provided by the NIH and USGS.  
* If appropriate for the field or journal, as machine readable tables in the supplemental material of a peer-reviewed publication. This may be the best solution for small data sets or individual tables that accompany a peer-reviewed publication, but the use of a community-recognized repository is encouraged. 

The method for sharing the data must be described as part of the data management plan.  Especially for very large data sets that might not fit into existing guidance, the PI must describe in their DMP how they will share them, what is appropriate to share, and include the costs for sharing them in their budget. 

## FAIR Data
When sharing data, researchers should follow the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship. The FAIR Principles include ensuring that data are:
* ~**F**indable~ - consistent and persistent descriptions make scientific data easy to find by both humans and computers
* **A**ccessible - use of standard, open protocols ensure data and metadata can be accessed by all.
* **I**nteroperable - formal, accessible, and widely adopted semantics and vocabularies are used to expand data usability across systems and communities
* ~**R**eusable~ - data are richly described according to standards to ensure they can be combined or replicated, and usage rights are clarified

The Sharing Data guidance below is consistent with the FAIR Guiding Principles. 
Sharing Data
The following items are required (denoted using “shall”) or recommended (denoted using “should”) when publicly sharing research data developed using SMD funding. These items help ensure that data are preserved and accessible to support reproducibility and reuse, and they are consistent with the FAIR Guiding Principles. 
Open accessibility: Publicly available, SMD-funded data shall be made available without fee or restriction of use. The data shall be shared in a repository that provides broad, equitable, and maximally open access to datasets and their metadata free of charge in a timely manner after submission, consistent with legal and policy requirements related to maintaining privacy and confidentiality, Tribal and national data sovereignty, and protection of sensitive data. The data will be accessible to the public (lay and scientific) without pre-approval. 
Format: SMD-funded data and metadata shall be made available for access, download, or export in non-proprietary, modifiable, open, and machine-readable formats consistent with standards used in the disciplines the repository serves.
Inclusion of metadata: SMD-funded data shall include robust, standards-compliant metadata that clearly and explicitly describe the data. Inclusion of metadata by the repository enables discovery, reuse, and citation of SMD-funded data. 
Clear guidance on use: Publicly available SMD-funded data shall be reusable with a clear, open, and accessible data license. If there are no other restrictions on the data, the data should be released with a Creative Commons Zero License. This provides a clear license for the user that the scientific data is in the worldwide public domain and that they may use it freely. In some cases, there might be existing restrictions on releasing the data due to intellectual property rights, contract restrictions, underlying licenses, or other issues. If unsure, contact your counsel that can help with intellectual property rights or ask for clarifications at HQ-SMD-SPD41@mail.nasa.gov. 
Persistent identifiers: Publicly available SMD-funded data collections shall be citable using unique persistent identifiers (e.g., DOI) assigned by the repository to support data discovery, reporting, and research assessment. 
Findability: SMD-funded data shall be findable, such that the data can be retrieved, downloaded, indexed, and searched. The data must be shared in a repository that will ensure that data are searchable and be provided with descriptive metadata along with the data collections.
