# Types of Research Software and Expectations for Sharing
Different types of research software have different expectations and practices for being shared openly, as defined in Appendix F of SPD-41a.

## Single use
Software written for use in unique instances, such as making a plot for a paper or manipulating data in a specific way. Single-use software developed from SMD-funding shall be released no later than with the publication it supports. It can be released as supplementary material to the publication or shared in a data repository that produces a permanent identifier that is linked to from the publication.

## Libraries
Generic tools, often with a larger user base, implementing well known algorithms, providing statistical analysis or visualization, etc., that are incorporated in other software categories. Libraries developed using SMD funding shall be released no later than the publication it supports. Libraries should be developed openly in a version-controlled platform and SMD-funded researchers are encouraged to contribute to existing, open source libraries. Major versions or releases of the software should be archived in a NASA designated repository.

## Analysis software
Generalized software (not low-level libraries) used to manipulate measurements or model results to visualize or gain understanding. This software often evolves from single-use utility software and may incorporate libraries. Analysis software developed from SMD-funding shall be released no later than the publication it supports. Analysis software should be developed openly in a version-controlled platform and SMD-funded researchers are encouraged to contribute to existing, open source analysis software. Major versions or releases of the software should be archived in a NASA designated repository.

## Model and simulation software
Software that either implements solutions to mathematical equations given input data and boundary conditions or infers models from data. Includes first-principles models, data-assimilation tools, empirical models, machine learning, mission planning and engineering tools, among others. They often use libraries.

Model and Simulation software developed from SMD funding shall be released no later than the peer-review publication it supports. Model and Simulation software should be developed openly in a version controlled platform and SMD-funded researchers are encouraged to contributed to existing, open source software. Major versions or releases of the software should be archived in a NASA designated repository.

## Data processing
Software for processing uncalibrated sensor measurements into calibrated sensor data and derived data products. This software type applies calibration coefficients, corrections or algorithms, which may be dependent on forward modeling, simulated observations, equations, and data filtering. It may include modeling and simulation software and libraries.

Data processing software developed under research grants from SMD funding shall be released no later than the peer-review publication it supports. Data processing software should be developed openly in a version-controlled platform and SMD-funded researchers are encouraged to contribute to existing, open source software. Major versions or releases of the software should be archived in a NASA designated repository.

## Commercial software
Software produced for the purposes of sale. This includes software
that would be classified as commercial-off-the-shelf (CoTS) and software that NASA does not have a license to distribute. Commercial software is not required to be released. SMD-funded research software developed in a commercial language (a programming language that requires a license to compile or run software) is not considered commercial software and shall be shared in a similar manner as other types of software developed in open languages.
