# NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Ethical AI Playbook


# Introduction

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) technologies have become invaluable tools in Earth and space sciences, offering unique capabilities for analyzing data, improving traditional physics-based models, predicting natural disasters, and more. However, the adoption of these technologies presents ethical challenges and responsibilities that extend beyond the standard scientific code of conduct. Ethical standards are crucial for ensuring that AI/ML applications in science are conducted in an open, inclusive manner while considering alternatives to adverse impacts on any potential communities and society as a whole.

The NASA  Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Scientific Ethics and Integrity policy governs members of the SMD community. This policy serves as a foundation for ethical AI/ML practices, which are further supplemented by specific AI/ML ethics, principles and responsibilities frameworks. These additional guidelines focus on enhancing research methods, documentation, reproducibility, and accountability for the impacts of research. They also set proactive expectations for professional societies, funders, and other institutional actors.

In summary, Ethical AI in this context refers to the application of AI/ML tools in scientific research in a manner that adheres to established ethical standards, is transparent and inclusive, and eliminates potential harm, while also considering the broader societal implications.

The rapid growth of AI/ML-enabled research and applications in NASA's SMD necessitates ethical considerations. Ethical AI is not optional; it must be prioritized over successful AI.

Factors contributing to ethical challenges in AI projects include the rush to deploy AI without proper ethical considerations, insufficient resources allocated for ethical AI, lack of team diversity, and the absence of a formal ethical AI code of conduct. This playbook offers AI project proposers and funders a practical set of guidelines to establish an ethical code of conduct and evaluate compliance. By implementing these guidelines, the SMD can be proactive in managing AI enabled research projects and identify potential pitfalls before they happen. 

This guidance will undergo continuous review and updates to ensure it remains relevant and helpful in navigating the use of AI, especially, Large Language Models (LLMs). The evolution of LLM technologies and the feedback from users will significantly contribute to the refinement of these guidelines over time.


# Guidance to proposers:



### 1.  Compliance with NASA Science Research Guidelines:
a. Ensure SMD-funded AI/ML projects adhere to [NASA's Scientific and Research Integrity Guidelines](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_guidelines_for_promoting_scientific_and_research_integrity-july_2018.pdf).

### 2. Integration of Ethical AI Best Practices throughout Research Lifecycle:
a. **Planning**: Anticipate AI/ML use and document the life-cycle stages (e.g., use case and data understanding, feature selection, model selection and development, quality control safeguards, deployment, adoption and democratization).

b. **Review**: Assess each stage for ethical considerations, including bias and stakeholder input.

### 3. Proposal Submission:
a. Consult with social scientists to assess ethical considerations with the proposed activity.

b. Plan for bias assessment, reproducibility, and validation.

### 4. Impact Review:
a. If relevant, involve stakeholders and communities potentially impacted by the proposed AI project.

b. Demonstrate mitigation strategies or explore alternatives.

### 5. Model Assessment:
a. Document design, limitations, and intended use.

b. Develop mitigation methods for biases and uncertainties.


### 6. Transparency and Accountability:
a. Make documentation open and accessible.

b.Establish a point of contact for deployed models and datasets.

### 7. Community Involvement:
a. If relevant, engage communities impacted by the proposed AI technology.

b. Include their perspectives in training resources.

### 8. Open Verification:
a. Ensure research outcomes can be verified with open-sourced algorithms and data.

### 9. Compliance with IRBs:
a. Stay updated with government and IRB best practices.

b. Adapt to new guidelines promptly.

The playbook has been developed based on a range of community feedback and townhall discussions led by the [American Geophysical Union](https://www.agu.org/). Further details about the individuals involved and the process can be accessed at [https://data.agu.org/ethics-ai-ml/](https://data.agu.org/ethics-ai-ml/).
