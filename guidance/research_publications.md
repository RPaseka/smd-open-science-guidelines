# Publications

NASA has a mandate to make the publications produced as part of its scientific activities openly accessible and to preserve this publications.    This includes the scientific and technical documents released through print, electronic, or alternative media. Open access to these publications help to support the scientific process, assures the widest disemmentation of the information that NASA produces, and supports anyone, anywhere in reading the results of NASA scientific activities.  

Publications include peer reviewed manuscripts, technical reports, conference materials, and books. This does not include laboratory notebooks, preliminary analyses, drafts of scientific papers or preprints, plans for future research, peer review reports, or communications with colleagues.

## Peer reviewed publications

Peer reviewed publications supported by NASA must be made publicly available within 12 months of the publication date via a NASA designated repository. Researchers who are supported by SMD have several different options for how to make their publications publicly accessible:

1. Researchers can publish in journals that are part of the Clearinghouse for the Open Research of the United States ([CHORUS](https://www.chorusaccess.org)) publishing group. These publications will be made automatically accessible through the NASA Scientific and Technical Information (STI) repository.
2. Research can publish the article as open access and the publication is indexed in the NASA [Astrophysics Data System](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu).
3. Researchers can submit to the NASA STI [PubSpace](https://sti.nasa.gov/submit-to-pubspace/) service and have their publication made available within 12 months of publication.

More details on NASAâ€™s public access policy requirements and submission guidance for scientific and technical information can be found on the NASA STI Program website. 

NASA researchers are encouraged to publish their peer-reviewed manuscripts as open access. Costs for publishing as open access are allowable costs.  Researchers are also encouraged to post their manuscripts to community appropriate preprint servers such as the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) or the [Earth and Space Science Open Archive](https://www.essoar.org).
