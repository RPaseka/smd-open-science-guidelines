# Science Mission Directorate Open-Source Science Guidance

**Note** 
This repository is currently a work in progress.  This work is being done openly and is still in development.  Please see the section on Limitations in the README.  

NASA’s [Open-Source Science Initiative \(OSSI\)](https://science.nasa.gov/open-science-overview) is a comprehensive program of activities to enable and support moving science towards openness, and it aims to implement [SMD's Strategy for Data Management and Computing for Groundbreaking Science 2019-2024](https://science.nasa.gov/files/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/SDMWG%20Strategy_Final.pdf). OSSI includes a commitment to the open sharing of software, data, and knowledge (algorithms, papers, documents, ancillary information) as early as possible in the scientific process. The principles of open-source science are to make publicly funded scientific research transparent, inclusive, accessible, and reproducible. 

As part of the OSSI, [SMD’s Scientific Information Policy](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/science-data/science-information-policy) provides guidance on the open sharing of publications, data, and software created in the pursuit of scientific knowledge. [SPD-41a: Scientific Information Policy for the Science Mission Directorate](https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/SMD-information-policy-SPD-41a.pdf) updates the previously released [SPD-41](https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/Scientific%20Information%20policy%20SPD-41.pdf), which consolidated existing Federal and NASA policy on sharing scientific information.  SPD-41a was developed in light of new federal guidance on [Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf), studies from the National Academies, and input from the SMD scientific community. 

This repository provides guidelines, best practices, and examples of open-source science to support the SMD scientific community in implementing the requirements of SPD-41a and achieving the broad OSSI goal of moving science towards openness. This guidance represents general recommendations and best practices for the SMD scientific community and should be considered alongside any additional guidance provided by SMD Divisions or specific funding solicitations. For additional information about SPD-41a and other scientific information policies that correspond to SMD Divisions, see the [Scientific Information Policy website](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/science-data/science-information-policy) and [Frequently Asked Questions \(FAQ\)](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/science-data/science-information-policy_faq). For open science training opportunities and additional resources, see [NASA’s Transform to Open Science \(TOPS\) program](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/). 

## Open Science

A collaborative culture enabled by technology that empowers the open sharing of data, information, and knowledge within the scientific community and the wider public to accelerate scientific research and understanding.

## Limitations

This repository does not establish policy requirements related to SMD funded activities. While the guidance described here is compliant with [SPD-41a: Scientific Information Policy for the Science Mission Directorate](https://science.nasa.gov/spd-41), it may not be comprehensive or complete, and there may be other ways in which to comply with existing or future agreements or requirements not described here. 
For requirements related to scientific information on SMD-funded activities, please see [SPD-41a](https://science.nasa.gov/spd-41), NASA policies, and/or any requirements in the solicitation or agreement associated with the activity.
