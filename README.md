# Science Mission Directorate Open Science Guidelines

**Note** 
This repository is currently a work in progress.  This work is being done openly and is still in development.  Please see the section on Limitations in the README.  


NASA has a mandate to openly share the scientific information produced from its activities.  To support this mandate, SMD has developed an ambitious open science vision in [SMD's Strategy for Data Management and Computing for Groundbreaking Science 2019-2024](https://science.nasa.gov/files/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/SDMWG%20Strategy_Final.pdf). SMD released [SPD-41: Scientific Information policy for the Science Mission Directorate](https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/Scientific%20Information%20policy%20SPD-41.pdf) to help consolidate existing Federal and NASA policy on sharing our scientific information.   This includes how scientific publications, data, and software are shared to increase accessibility, transparency, reproducibility, and inclusion to support SMD's scientific communities. 

This repository provides guidelines, best practies, and examples in open science to support the scientific community.  For more information on training in open science, see the [Transform to Open Science](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science) repository.  For more information on the Scientific Information policy, please see the [Scientific Information Policy](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/science-data/science-information-policy) website.  

## Open Science

A collaborative culture enabled by technology that empowers the open sharing of data, information, and knowledge within the scientific community and the wider public to accelerate scientific research and understanding.

## Contributing

Contributions to the repository are welcome! Following the best practices of open science, the material in the repository can be best built through the collective knowledge of the community. For reporting something that needs to be fixed or suggesting an addition, contributions can be made through opening an issue in the repository. If you are interested in contributing material directly to the repository, please see the following guides:

* [Contributors Guide](Contributing)
* The process for developing new guidelines are still being refined, but [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DaFJpTCfl3cuTqBn7c32Bs8RNxRsa3vJnurmgh9SlXA/edit?usp=sharing) provides an overview.

For any questions, please contact the maintainers or send an email to <HQ-SMD-SPD41@mail.nasa.gov>. 

## Limitations

This repository includes guidelines, best practices, and examples of Open Science, and this repository does not include requirements related to SMD funded activities.  While these practices are compliant with [SPD-41: Scientific Information policy for the Science Mission Directorate](https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/Scientific%20Information%20policy%20SPD-41.pdf), they may not be comprehensive or complete, and there may be other ways in which to be compliant with existing or future agreements or requiements not described here. For requirements related to scientific information on SMD-funded activities, please see the [SPD-41: Scientific Information policy for the Science Mission Directorate](https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/Scientific%20Information%20policy%20SPD-41.pdf), NASA policies, and/or any requirements in the solicitation or agreement associated with the activity.  

This repository will be updated as new information becomes available.
